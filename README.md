Fist repo, just for practice. Clone design of first web page of Spotify with HTML and CSS.

# About
I made this project to demonstrate my HTML and CSS skills.
Code is as efficient and readable as possible. HTML code is divided into main sections then their subsections and their subsections if needed with intuitive class and id names. Further CSS properties like Flexbox, Scrollbar, Media Queries, etc are used.
Spotify Page Contents: Sidebar which contains home, search and library options | Main Content which contains navigation bar and cards for music & playlist | Music Player bar
